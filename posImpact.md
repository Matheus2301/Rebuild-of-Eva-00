## Review process

### Production Readiness Review (PRR)

<!-- A PRR is held for Flight System and Ground Support projects developing or acquiring multiple or similar systems greater than three or as determined by the project. The PRR determines the readiness of the system developers to efficiently produce the required number of systems. It ensures that the production plans; fabrication, assembly, and integration enabling products; and personnel are in place and ready to begin production. -->

### Test Readiness Review (TRR)

<!-- A TRR ensures that the [[test article (engineering)|test article]] (hardware/software), test facility, support personnel, and test procedures are ready for testing and data acquisition, reduction, and control. This is not a prerequisite for Key Decision Point entry. -->

### System Acceptance Review (SAR)

<!-- The SAR verifies the completeness of the specific end products in relation to their expected maturity level and assesses compliance to stakeholder expectations. The SAR examines the system, its end products and documentation, and test data and analyses that support verification. It also ensures that the system has sufficient technical maturity to authorize its shipment to the designated operational facility or launch site. -->

### Operational Readiness Review (ORR)

<!-- The ORR examines the actual system characteristics and the procedures used in the system or end product's operation and ensures that all system and support (flight and ground) hardware, software, personnel, procedures, and user documentation accurately reflect the deployed state of the system.

The following are typical objectives of an ORR:

* Establish that the system is ready to transition into an operational mode through examination of available ground and flight test results, analyses, and operational demonstrations
* Confirm that the system is operationally and logistically supported in a satisfactory manner considering all modes of operation and support (normal, contingency, and unplanned)
* Establish that operational documentation is complete and represents the system configuration and its planned modes of operation
* Establish that the training function is in place and has demonstrated capability to support all aspects of system maintenance, preparation, operation, and recovery. -->

### Flight Readiness Review (FRR)

<!-- The FRR examines tests, demonstrations, analyses, and audits that determine the system's readiness for a safe and successful flight or launch and for subsequent flight operations. It also ensures that all flight and ground hardware, software, personnel, and procedures are operationally ready.

The following are typical objectives{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} of a FRR:

* Receive certification that flight operations can safely proceed with acceptable risk.
* Confirm that the system and support elements are properly configured and ready for launch.
* Establish that all interfaces are compatible and function as expected.
* Establish that the system state supports a launch "go" decision based on go/no-go criteria. -->
